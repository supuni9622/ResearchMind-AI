- Provider abstraction (`VectorStoreProviderInterface`)
- Registry Pattern
- Composition Root (`create.py`)
- Qdrant provider — collection create/exists, batched upsert, delete-by-document, count, collection info

Documentation

- ADR-017 — Vector Store Platform Architecture

# Milestone 2.6 — Indexing Platform (Hybrid Retrieval)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

ResearchMind now indexes both a dense and a sparse vector for every chunk into the same Qdrant collection, enabling native hybrid retrieval without a separate BM25 platform.

Implemented

- `IndexingService` — orchestrates dense+sparse record building, collection creation, upsert, statistics, artifact persistence
- `FastEmbedSparseEmbeddingProvider` — SPLADE sparse vectors (`prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1`), generated off the event loop via `asyncio.to_thread`
- Qdrant collection schema migrated from a single unnamed vector to named `dense` + `sparse` vectors per point
- `IndexingRequest` extended to carry the source `ChunkArtifact` (sparse generation needs raw chunk text)
- `IndexingArtifact` / `indexing.json`, `IndexStatistics.indexed_sparse_vectors`
- Fixed a latent bug: `VectorPayload.chunk_index` was hardcoded to `0` for every chunk; now reflects the real chunk position

Manual Verification

- Dropped and recreated the dev `researchmind_knowledge` Qdrant collection (old single-vector schema → new dense+sparse schema)
- Ran the real pipeline end-to-end (Voyage AI dense + FastEmbed SPLADE sparse + Qdrant), confirmed both named vectors present
- Issued a real sparse-vector query — the keyword-relevant chunk scored 17.15 vs. 0.66 for an unrelated chunk, confirming lexical matching works
- Full test suite (234 tests), ruff, and mypy pass

Documentation

- ADR-018 — Knowledge Indexing and Retrieval Architecture
- ADR-019 — Qdrant Native Hybrid Retrieval
- `docs/architecture/hybrid-retrieval-indexing.md` — complete ingestion pipeline flow diagram, schema before/after, verification results

# Engineering Benchmark Platform

**Status:** ✅ Foundation Complete

Implemented

- Benchmark framework
- Registry
- Runner
- Dataset loader
- Markdown reports
- JSON reports
- Chunking Benchmark
- Embedding Benchmark
- Pipeline Benchmark — end-to-end ingestion benchmark (real Chunking → Embedding → Indexing), now reports dense + sparse vector counts per document; re-run after the hybrid indexing change confirmed indexing (SPLADE inference) is the new dominant per-document latency cost, ahead of embedding

Deferred

- Retrieval Benchmark

Reason

The Retrieval Platform itself has not been implemented yet.

# Current Focus

## Phase 2.7 — Retrieval Platform

With hybrid indexing complete, the next milestone builds the query side: retrieving from the dense+sparse vectors already indexed in Qdrant.

Planned scope (per ADR-019)

- Semantic Retrieval
- Sparse Retrieval
- Hybrid Retrieval (Qdrant fusion of dense + sparse)
- Metadata Filtering
- Voyage Reranker
- Parent/Child Retrieval
- Query Decomposition
- Retrieval Evaluation

`ai/knowledge/retrieval/` is currently an empty package.

# Long-Term Vision

ResearchMind is evolving into a production-grade AI Engineering Platform.

The platform is built around independent, provider-driven AI capabilities connected through canonical artifacts.

Every platform follows the same engineering principles:

- Canonical Models
- Canonical Artifacts
- Provider Pattern
- Registry Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Composition Roots
- Framework Independence
- Production-first Engineering
