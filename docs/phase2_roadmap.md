🟨 Processing Quality Pass (Next)

This is now our immediate focus before introducing queues.

2.2.6 Parser Intelligence
Metadata
Improve document metadata
Preserve Docling metadata
Replace temp path with canonical source
Statistics

Replace placeholders with real values:

Page count
Heading count
Paragraph count
Tables
Figures
Lists
References
Duplicate Detection

🚫 Deferred (Not MVP)

These remain intentionally postponed.

OCR

Decision:

Digital research papers only.

OCR will be introduced only when scanned PDFs become a requirement.

Citation Mapping

Requires semantic parsing.

Move to Phase 2.3.

Page Mapping

Will naturally fit with chunk generation.

Move to Phase 2.3.

Quality Score

Needs richer document analysis.

Move until after chunking.

⏳ Phase 2.3 — Chunking Platform

Once the Processing Quality Pass is complete:

Markdown

↓

Semantic Blocks

↓

Chunk Builder

↓

Chunk Metadata

↓

Chunk Persistence

This is where we'll build the document intelligence that powers RAG.

⏳ Phase 2.4 — Embedding Platform
Chunks

↓

Embedding Models

↓

Batch Embedding

↓

Qdrant
⏳ Phase 2.5 — Retrieval Platform
Hybrid Search

↓

Metadata Filters

↓

Reranking

↓

Context Builder
⏳ Phase 2.6 — RAG Engine
Retriever

↓

Context

↓

Prompt Builder

↓

LLM
⏳ Phase 2.7 — Queue & Workers

This stays exactly where we agreed.

BullMQ

↓

Workers

↓

Retry

↓

Dead Letter Queue

↓

Observability

Reason: We're making an already-correct synchronous workflow asynchronous, rather than debugging business logic inside background jobs.
