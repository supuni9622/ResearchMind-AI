🚫 Deferred (Not MVP)

These remain intentionally postponed.

OCR

Decision:

Digital research papers only.

OCR will be introduced only when scanned PDFs become a requirement.

Citation Mapping

Requires semantic parsing.

Move to Phase 2.3.

Page Mapping

Will naturally fit with chunk generation.

Move to Phase 2.3.

Quality Score

Needs richer document analysis.

Move until after chunking.

✅ Phase 2.3 — Chunking Platform (Complete)

Markdown

↓

Semantic Blocks

↓

Chunk Builder

↓

Chunk Metadata

↓

Chunk Persistence

Implemented strategies: Fixed, Recursive, Markdown. Benchmarked via
`benchmarks/chunking/`. Semantic/Parent-child/Agentic chunking deferred.

Status: COMPLETE

✅ Phase 2.4 — Embedding Platform (Complete)
Chunks

↓

Embedding Models

↓

Batch Embedding

↓

Qdrant

Providers: Sentence Transformers, Voyage AI, OpenAI. Valkey-backed
embedding cache with TTL. Benchmarked via `benchmarks/embeddings/`.

Status: COMPLETE

✅ Phase 2.5 — Retrieval Platform (Complete)
Hybrid Search ✅

↓

Metadata Filters ✅

↓

Reranking ✅ (Voyage AI + CrossEncoder)

↓

Parallel Retrieval ✅ (dense + sparse via `asyncio.gather`)

Implemented: query validation/normalization, dense (Voyage AI) search,
sparse (SPLADE) search, hybrid search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion,
query embedding cache (Valkey), metadata filtering (`document_id`,
`filename`, `owner_id`, `language`, server-enforced `owner_id`),
Voyage AI + CrossEncoder reranking, parallel dense+sparse execution,
retrieval evaluation (Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR, NDCG@K, latency,
cost — `benchmarks/retrieval/`, `benchmarks/reranking/`, ADR-020).

Reclassified: Parent/Child retrieval moved out of this platform into
the Context Platform below (2.6), since persisted chunk artifacts —
not the vector index — are the source of truth for parent resolution.
Query Decomposition moved to the future Research Runtime.

APIs: `POST /retrieve`, `POST /retrieve/sparse`, `POST /retrieve/hybrid`.

Status: COMPLETE

✅ Phase 2.6 — Context Platform (Complete — Phase 3.7, `context_platform_complexion_prd.md`)
Parent Expansion ✅

↓

Adjacent Merge ✅

↓

Compression (Token Budget + Embedding + LangChain + LLM, V1-V4) ✅

↓

Guardrails V1 ✅

↓

Citation Platform ✅

↓

Prompt Formatter ✅

Implemented: `ChunkArtifactReader`, `ParentExpansionService`,
`AdjacentMergeService`, Token Budget + Embedding + LangChain
(`ContextualCompressionRetriever` + `LLMChainExtractor`) + LLM
(per-chunk `GenerationService.generate()` summarization) Compression
providers, `RuleBasedGuardrailProvider` with risk scoring, citation IDs/pages/
headings/chunk IDs, and strategy-based prompt formatting (`DEFAULT`,
`NOTEBOOKLM`, `PERPLEXITY`, `RESEARCH`, `AGENT`). The LangChain compression
provider (V3) is now wired into `ContextBuilderService.build()`'s default
pipeline, gated by `settings.enable_langchain_compression` and gated on a
`query` being passed; the LLM provider (V4) is implemented and registered
but intentionally not part of the default pipeline.

Status: COMPLETE

✅ Phase 2.7 — Generation Platform (complete, per `generation_platform_complexion_prd.md` — structured output, validation (incl. all five runtime contracts and every PRD output validator), a validation policy layer, regeneration, prompt bridge, routing, caching, streaming, runtime metrics, and artifacts all done; the Generation Runtime Platform (2.7.1) and Research API (2.7.2) below complete the picture)
Prompt Context

↓

Generation Service (native structured output → parser fallback → validation → regeneration)

↓

LLM Provider (Groq, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama)

↓

Generated Answer

This replaces the earlier "RAG Engine" placeholder now that Retrieval
and Context are done. Provider Structured Output Integration is
complete for all five providers (native schema-constrained decoding,
parser/repair fallback, Markdown/XML registry), plus an optional
LangChain `with_structured_output()` path (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Ollama),
Output Validation (JSON, schema, formatting, completeness, consistency,
response size, citation — full pipeline, `generation/validation/`), a
regenerate-on-invalid-output loop (`max_regeneration_attempts`, now
policy-driven via `AcceptancePolicy`), a provider-capability-mismatch
guard, and `generate_from_template()` bridging the existing Prompt
Platform into Generation with schema-aware format instructions. Detail:
`docs/architecture/structured-output-platform.md`.

Also now complete: a Routing Platform (scored model catalog, task-based
strategies, capability/policy filtering, fallback chains —
`routing_platform_prd.md`, ADR-026), a Runtime Caching Platform (L1
exact/L2 semantic/L3 session, policy resolution —
`runtime_caching_platform_prd.md`, ADR-027), a Streaming Platform
(canonical event protocol, SSE/WebSocket, wired into `POST
/api/v1/chat/stream` / `/api/v1/chat/ws`, plus owner-scoped `GET /api/v1/chat/conversations` and `GET /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id}` replay — `streaming_platform_prd.md`,
ADR-028), five per-runtime Validation Contracts (Research, Planner,
Reviewer, Agent, MCP — `generation/validation/runtime/contracts/`), a
Validation Policy Layer (`AcceptancePolicy`/`FailFastPolicy`/
`RuntimeValidationPolicy`, `generation/policies/`), Runtime Metrics
Integration (`GenerationMetricsService`, `generation/observability/`),
and an Artifact Platform (canonical, immutable, policy-gated
`GenerationArtifact` persistence — incl. a `metrics.json` snapshot — on
every `generate()` call — `artifacts_platform_prd.md`), all per
`generation_platform_complexion_prd.md`.

Now built: a Generation Runtime Platform (see Phase 2.7.1 below,
`generation_runtime_platform_prd.md`) gives every future runtime one
canonical `execute_generation()` entrypoint, and a Research API (see
Phase 2.7.2 below, `research_api_prd.md`) is its first real caller,
setting `GenerationRequest.runtime = RESEARCH` so that runtime contract
actually runs end-to-end; Planner/Reviewer/Agent/MCP contracts remain
registered-but-dormant until their own runtimes exist.
Hallucination validation and generation-level guardrails are both
complete elsewhere: a `HallucinationValidator` ships as part of
`generation/validation/`, and a Guardrails Platform
(`apps/api/app/ai/guardrails/`, see `guardrails_platform_prd.md`)
covers input/retrieval/generation/runtime guardrails as an MVP
foundation — wired directly into this service (see
`guardrail_integration_prd.md`): an input-stage gate runs before every
provider call, and the full guardrail report lands on
`GenerationResult.guardrails` before validation runs.

Status: COMPLETE

✅ Phase 2.7.1 — Generation Runtime Platform (Complete, per `generation_runtime_platform_prd.md`)
Prompt Context + Generation Service (existing, frozen ordering)

↓

Orchestration (`runtime/generation/orchestration/`)

↓

execute_generation() / GenerationRuntime.execute()

↓

Future Runtime Callers (Research, Planner, Reviewer, Agent, MCP)

A thin orchestration layer, not a reimplementation: `GenerationService.generate()`
already runs the full frozen ordering (input validation → input guardrails →
routing → cache → provider execution → structured outputs → generation
guardrails → output validation → runtime validation → metrics → artifacts)
from prior milestones. This platform adds one canonical entrypoint —
`execute_generation(request, provider=None) -> GenerationResult` and
`GenerationRuntime.execute()` — plus a new `get_generation_runtime()` FastAPI
dependency, so future runtimes tag `GenerationRequest.runtime` and call this
instead of reaching into `GenerationService` directly. No state machines, no
DAGs, no LangGraph duplication (explicit Non-Goals, honored — LangGraph
remains future work). 11 new unit tests, all passing.

Status: COMPLETE

✅ Phase 2.7.2 — Research API (Complete, per `research_api_prd.md`)
Upload

↓

Ask (`POST /research`, `/research/stream`)

↓

Retrieval Platform (hybrid search + rerank)

↓

Context Platform (dedup/expand/merge/compress/cite)

↓

Generation Runtime Platform (execute_generation())

↓

Streaming Platform (SSE)

↓

Artifact Platform (Research artifact writer, best-effort persistence)

↓

research_sessions (Postgres, replay via `GET /research/{id}`)

The first live, end-to-end product surface in ResearchMind: a user can
upload documents, ask a question, and get a grounded, cited, streamable
answer back. New routes: `POST /research`, `POST /research/stream` (SSE),
`POST /research/citations` (citation-panel preview, no generation), `GET
/research/{id}` (replay); all auth-required, owner-scoped. New
`ResearchService` (`apps/api/app/ai/research/service.py`) composes the
Retrieval, Context, Generation Runtime, Streaming, and Artifact Platforms.
New Postgres `research_sessions` table (model + repository + Alembic
migration). First real exercise of `RuntimeType.RESEARCH` and
`ArtifactRuntime.RESEARCH` (previously reserved-but-unused). A later
follow-up added server-backed `research_conversations` and a
`conversation_id` on `research_sessions`, so Research history is now a
conversation thread containing many research turns rather than a sidebar
row per isolated question. Prior turns are folded into the next prompt,
and the Memory Platform's SESSION memories are scoped to the research
conversation id. Deliberately linear/simple per its own PRD's Non-Goals:
no query decomposition, no research planning/multi-step loops, no agents,
no LangGraph - a Research Runtime, Deep Research Runtime, Agent Platform,
and LangGraph all remain future roadmap items. 23 new tests shipped with
the original API milestone; route-level tests for the newer
`/research/conversations` endpoints should still be added.

Reason: We're making an already-correct synchronous workflow asynchronous, rather than debugging business logic inside background jobs.
